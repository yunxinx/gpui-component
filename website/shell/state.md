# State and Views

A View is the one thing in this runtime that has an identity, survives a frame, and is owned by GPUI. Everything else — elements, callbacks, the `cx` handed to a call — belongs to the pass that created it.

## Defining a View

```js
import { View } from "gpui";

export default class Counter extends View {
  init(props) {
    this.count = props?.start ?? 0;
  }

  render(cx) {
    return v_flex().child(`${this.count}`);
  }
}
```

`init` runs once, when the View is created. It is where state that survives frames is set up — plain fields, and any [retained entity](#retained-state) the View needs.

`render` **returns one element, retained `Entity` or string**, and runs when the View has been invalidated rather than on every frame — see [When `render` runs](#when-render-runs). Returning anything else fails immediately:

```text
render(cx) must return an element, an Entity, or a string
```

`main.js` must `export default` a View class. The host constructs one instance and mounts it as the window's root View; a module whose default export is not a class is refused with a message saying so.

Never store an element on the instance. See [Elements](./elements.md#elements-are-single-use).

## `cx.notify()`

Nothing repaints on its own. There are no signals, no observables and no automatic dependency tracking. Change state, then ask for a re-render:

```js
add(cx) {
  this.items = [...this.items, { id: this.nextId, caption, done: false }];
  this.nextId += 1;
  cx.notify();
}
```

This runs against the whole default assumption of the front-end ecosystem, so it is worth stating flatly: **there is no `useState` here, and no dependency array.** Three reasons the runtime does not add one.

GPUI is itself an explicit-`notify` model, and two reactive mental models inside one application interfere with each other rather than compose. Automatic tracking would mean wrapping every View instance in a `Proxy`, which is a permanent cost on the render path — and QuickJS has no JIT to amortize it. And a missing `notify` has a determinate symptom: the interface does not update. That is far cheaper to find than an automatic system that fires too often.

Several `notify` calls inside one event handler collapse into a single repaint — and into a single `render`.

## When `render` runs

`render` does **not** run once per frame. GPUI repaints for reasons your application never hears about — a pointer moving over a button, a text cursor blinking, a list scrolling, an animation advancing — and none of those are a reason to run JavaScript.

So a `render` call does not describe *this frame*. It describes the interface once, into a Snapshot the runtime keeps:

```text
cx.notify()  ──▶  render()  ──▶  Snapshot  ──┬──▶  frame
                                             ├──▶  frame
                                             └──▶  frame  …
```

The Snapshot is rebuilt when, and only when, something invalidates it:

- `cx.notify()` from an event handler or an async task
- a [hot-reload](./getting-started.md) replacing the script
- a theme change, because `bg(cx.theme().colors.surface)` records a real colour while `render` runs and bakes it into the Snapshot
- the Host calling `ScriptView::refresh`, which is how Rust says it changed state your script reads through a [HostModule](./host-module.md). A plain `cx.notify()` from the Host is a repaint and runs no script — the two are different requests

Everything else replays the description you already produced, in Rust, without running any JavaScript.

Three consequences worth holding on to:

**Your `render` cost follows your users, not your frame rate.** A View that changes ten times a second costs ten renders a second, whether the window is repainting at 60 FPS or 120. Describing a large panel is affordable precisely because it is not being redescribed sixty times for no reason.

**Hover, focus and active styles never call back into script.** `.hover(s => s.opacity(0.8))` is resolved into a native style description while the Snapshot is built, and GPUI applies it from there. A pointer moving across your interface runs no JavaScript at all. The same is true of an [`Input`](#retained-state)'s cursor and selection.

**A failed `render` does not destroy the interface.** A Snapshot is published only after `render` returns successfully, so a script that throws leaves the previous description — and the handlers registered with it — exactly as they were. The failure appears as a banner **over** the interface that still works, saying it is one version behind and offering the detail for pasting somewhere; you keep your scroll position and your focus. A View whose very first render failed has nothing to keep, and gets the full error surface instead. Either way the failing `render` is not re-run until something invalidates the View again.

## Scope phases

Every call from Rust into the script opens a scope carrying a **phase**, and the phase decides what the `cx` for that call may do.

| `ScopePhase` | When | May | May not |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `render` | Building an element tree | Read state, build elements, register callbacks | `notify`, open overlays, create retained state |
| `event` | Handling a click or a change | Everything | Block |
| `task` | Resuming asynchronous work | Everything | Block |
| `layout` | Rendering one virtualized item inside GPUI's layout pass | Read state, build elements | `notify`, open overlays, create retained state |

`cx.phase()` reports the current one, and `"none"` outside any host call.

`cx.theme()` returns a deeply read-only Snapshot of gpui-base's current semantic theme for this call: direct color roles as well as `colors`, `spacing`, `radius`, `appearance`, and `is_dark`.

Each refusal is a specific message, not undefined behaviour:

```text
cx.notify() is not allowed during the `render` phase;
request a re-render from an event handler instead
```

Notifying yourself while rendering is a loop, which is why it is refused rather than deferred.

## Two kinds of `cx`

`&mut Window` and `&mut App` are borrows in GPUI: they live exactly as long as one call. A script object outlives any borrow, so the script-side `cx` cannot hold them. GPUI has a second flavour for the code that needs one anyway — `AsyncApp`, which `cx.spawn` hands its closure — and so does this.

**`Context`** is what `render` and every event handler receive. It holds a **generation number**, checked against the live scope stack on every use, so keeping one past its call is an error rather than a corrupted frame:

```text
cx is no longer valid: it was captured during an earlier call and used later.
Use cx.spawn or take cx from the callback arguments instead.
```

**`AsyncContext`** is what `init` receives, and what `cx.spawn` and `cx.timer` hand their callbacks. It names no call at all — it resolves whichever one is running when you use it — so an `await` does not take it away:

```js
async save(cx) {
  await cx.sleep(100);
  cx.notify();          // the same cx, still the right one
}
```

Those three are exactly the places whose job is to set up or continue work that outlives the call they started in. Everywhere else the strict flavour is what you want, and being told you kept it too long is the point.

`cx` exposes nothing but functions — `Object.keys(cx)` shows the methods and no generation — so a script cannot forge one.

There is no third way to get one. A module's top level and a bare `constructor` are handed no context and cannot ask for one — which is the point rather than a gap: GPUI has no module top level either, and work started there would belong to no View, so nothing would own it and nothing would cancel it. Start it in `init`, which is where a View is handed its context.

## Retained state

A View's own fields hold plain data. Anything with cross-frame machinery of its own — a text field's content, cursor position and undo history — lives in a GPUI entity, and the script holds a **handle** to it.

```js
import { InputState, Input } from "gpui-base";

init() {
  this.draft = InputState.new({ placeholder: "What needs doing?" });
  this.draft.on("submit", (_event, cx) => this.add(cx));
}

render(cx) {
  return Input.new(this.draft)
    .flex_1()
    .h(28)
    .px(8)
    .border(1)
    .border_color(cx.theme().colors.input)
    .bg(cx.theme().colors.surface)
    .text_size(12);
}
```

| Call | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `InputState.new({ placeholder, value })` | Creates the state; both options are optional |
| `state.value()` | The current text |
| `state.set_value(text)` | Replaces it |
| `state.on(event, handler)` | Subscribes; see below |
| `state.release()` | Drops the handle |
| `Input.new(state)` | The element that renders it |

**Create it in `init` or an event handler, never in `render`.** Creating an entity needs a live window, and the render pass is the one place where doing so would be wrong anyway:

```text
InputState.new(...) cannot run during render; create state in init()
or in an event handler and keep it on the View
```

The script holds a handle, not the entity — GPUI owns that. Using a released handle throws rather than returning `undefined`, because an `undefined` in JavaScript travels a long way before it fails and by then the origin is gone:

```text
this input state has been released
```

`Input` is the one element the runtime gives defaults to, and only three: a centred row, full width, and a click anywhere in the frame focuses it. Each is a default a script can override but should not have to remember — without the first, text sits at the top of whatever height the frame was given, which on screen looks like a bug rather than a missing style.

### Input events

```js
this.draft.on("submit", (event, cx) => this.add(cx));
```

| Event | Fires on |
| --- | --- |
| `change` | The text changed |
| `submit` | Enter was pressed; `event.secondary` and `event.shift` say how |
| `focus` | The field gained focus |
| `blur` | It lost focus |

Unlike a rendered `on_click`, this subscription **outlives the render that created it**. The subscription is owned by the runtime's handle store rather than by the script, because a script has nowhere to keep it and a handler that stops firing because a value was garbage collected is the kind of bug nobody finds. It is released when the handle is.

A misspelled event name lists the valid ones:

```text
unknown input event `changed`; expected one of: change, submit, focus, blur
```

### Calendar state

`CalendarState` is the same pattern holding something different: which month is being looked at, which date is chosen, and the day grid that follows from both.

```js
init(_props, cx) {
  this.calendar = CalendarState.new();
  this.calendar.on("change", (date, cx) => this.pick(date, cx));
}

render(cx) {
  const grid = this.calendar.month_days()[0];
  return v_flex().children(
    grid.map((week) =>
      h_flex().gap(4).children(
        week.map((day) =>
          Button.new(day)
            .selected(day === this.calendar.value())
            .on_click((_e, cx) => { this.calendar.set_value(day); cx.notify(); })
            .child(String(Number(day.slice(8)))),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

`month_days()` is why it exists: which dates fall in which week, where the neighbouring months' days go, and how many weeks this month needs. You draw the cells — base's `Calendar` element is **not** bound, because it walks the same grid calling a renderer once per cell, up to forty-two crossings into JavaScript per frame from inside GPUI's layout pass, for cells that carry no behavior.

Dates are `"YYYY-MM-DD"`, a range is `[start, end]`, and nothing selected is `null`. A range stays a pair even before its end is chosen — `["2026-08-03", null]` does not collapse to its start — because "one day is selected" and "a range has been started" are different states to base, and its own logic branches on the difference.

| Call | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `CalendarState.new()` | Creates the state; like every retained handle, only in `init` or an event handler |
| `month_days()` | The grid, as months of weeks of days; every week is seven days |
| `year()` / `month()` / `today()` | The year and month the grid is for, and today as it was read at creation |
| `value()` / `set_value(next)` | The selection |
| `next_month()` / `prev_month()` | Moves the grid a month either way; illegal from `render` |
| `on("change", handler)` | The only event, reporting a date being selected |
| `release()` | Drops the handle |

## Asynchronous work

Script code is asynchronous in the ordinary JavaScript way — `async` functions and native promises. The runtime supplies the parts a bare QuickJS does not have: a clock, an owner for pending work, and something to pump the job queue.

| Call | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `cx.sleep(ms)` | A promise resolved after `ms` on GPUI's foreground executor |
| `cx.spawn(body, opts?)` | Calls `body(cx)` and adopts the promise it returns |
| `cx.timer.after(ms, handler, opts?)` | Calls `handler(cx)` once |
| `cx.timer.every(ms, handler, opts?)` | Calls `handler(cx)` repeatedly |

Scheduling is on `cx` because that is where GPUI keeps it — `App::spawn`, and a timer from the executor a context hands out. There is nothing to import.

All of them return work that runs on the main thread. Nothing script-visible ever leaves it: there is no `Worker`, and the VM and GPUI's `App` are both main-thread only.

```js
flash(cx) {
  this.saved = true;
  cx.notify();

  cx.spawn(async (cx) => {
    await cx.sleep(1500);
    this.saved = false;
    cx.notify();
  });
}
```

Nothing is imported for that: `cx` arrives as the handler's second argument, and the `cx` its body receives is the async flavour that survives the `await`.

**`spawn` adopts the promise, and that is the point.** An unhandled rejection is JavaScript's most common silent failure: the work stops, the interface keeps the state it had, and nothing is written anywhere. Here it reaches `tracing::error!` with the script's own stack.

### Ownership and cancellation

Every task belongs to a View — `opts.owner`, or the View that is running when it is created. The task holds a weak reference, so when the panel that started the work goes away the callback is skipped rather than writing into state nothing will render again.

```js
const handle = cx.timer.every(1000, (cx) => this.tick(cx));
handle.cancel();
handle.is_done();
```

`owner: null` opts out and outlives every View; it is the only value other than the current View the runtime accepts today.

Cancelling a `cx.sleep` leaves its promise **pending for ever**. That is what cancellation means for a promise: the continuation does not run, and no error is invented for code that asked to stop.

`cx.timer.every` measures its interval from the end of one call, so a slow handler delays the next tick rather than stacking ticks behind it.

### Timers and standard host APIs

```text
setTimeout  -> cx.timer.after(ms, callback)
setInterval -> cx.timer.every(ms, callback)
clearTimeout / clearInterval -> cancel() the Task returned by after / every
```

`setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearTimeout` and `clearInterval` are throwing stubs. Use `cx.timer.after` for one-shot work, `cx.timer.every` for repeated work, and call `cancel()` on the returned `Task` to stop either one. Global `fetch` and the safe standard modules documented under [Capabilities](./capabilities.md), including `websocket`, are real asynchronous host APIs. CommonJS `require` remains unavailable; use ES modules.

Browser DOM and storage are absent: there is no `document` or `localStorage`. The global `window` is gpui-shell's overlay host for dialogs, sheets and toasts; it is not a browser `Window` and exposes no DOM.

## Not there yet

- **Global and cross-view state.** There is no store beyond the persistence layer in [Capabilities](./capabilities.md) and ordinary module scope.
- **Actions and key bindings.** `gpui.action` and `gpui.keymap` are designed but not bound; the only key handling today is what `ShellRoot` installs (Tab, Shift-Tab, Escape).
- **Multiple windows.** The host opens the window; there is no `gpui.open_window`.
- **`gpui.gc_stats()`**, and the debug panel that would read it.
