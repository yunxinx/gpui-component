# Pagination

A controlled page navigator with explicit current and total page state.

Like every `gpui-base` primitive, Pagination supplies behavior and semantic structure without imposing a product visual language. Apply GPUI styles and compose the exported parts to match your design system.

## Example

The [single native Cargo entrypoint](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component/blob/main/crates/base/examples/components.rs) selects this primitive from the [shared showcase implementation](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component/blob/main/crates/base/examples/showcase/mod.rs). The same showcase is compiled once for the WASM preview above.

```bash
cargo run -p gpui-base --example components -- pagination
```

## Import

```rust
use gpui_base::{Pagination, PaginationState};
```

## Anatomy and API

The example composes `Pagination`, `PaginationState`. GPUI's standard styling and event traits provide presentation; these base types provide the interaction structure.

The authoritative module is [`components/pagination.rs`](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component/blob/main/crates/base/examples/showcase/components/pagination.rs). Native and browser previews compile this same file.

## State and events

`PaginationState` owns current and total pages; `on_change` reports valid requested pages.

Keep controlled state on the parent render type or in a GPUI entity. Update it in callbacks and call `cx.notify()`; do not recreate persistent entities during every render.

## Complete Rust example

The complete implementation used by the runnable showcase is embedded directly from Rust source:

<<< ../../../crates/base/examples/showcase/components/pagination.rs{rust}

The command above supplies application initialization, window creation, and shared `BaseShowcase` state.

## Accessibility

Identify current page, label previous/next, and disable unavailable boundary actions.

## Notes

Use stable element IDs where accepted. Verify focus, hover, active, selected, disabled, reduced-motion, and high-contrast appearances in the consuming design system.
