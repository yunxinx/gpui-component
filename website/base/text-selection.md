# Text Selection

`gpui-base` provides window-level text selection for ordinary GPUI participants. It coordinates pointer gestures, Shift-click extension, selection across multiple text elements, copying, scrolling, scopes, and multi-window lifetime without prescribing how text is laid out or highlighted.

Use it when you render text with `StyledText`, `TextLayout`, a virtualized document, or another custom GPUI `Element`.

## Get started

To add text selection to a custom GPUI participant, connect its layout and paint lifecycle to the window selection state as shown below.

A selectable window has three roles:

1. One `TextSelectionLayer` element owns the selection state and window pointer handlers.
2. Each independently selectable text participant owns a stable `TextSelectionHandle`.
3. During rendering, the participant registers current geometry and projects the resulting snapshot onto laid-out `TextSelectionRun`s.

### Key parts

| API | Lifetime | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TextSelectionLayer` | Once per window | Installs window-level pointer handling and selection state. |
| `TextSelection` | Static API | Queries and controls the window selection. |
| `TextSelectionHandle` | Once per selectable participant | Identifies the participant and stores its callbacks and projected selection. |
| `TextSelectionRegistration` | Recreated each rendered frame | Reports the current hitbox, bounds, scroll offset, scope, and document order. |
| `TextSelectionRun` | Recreated during paint | Describes laid-out text for projection to a UTF-8 byte range. |
| `TextSelectionProjection` | Returned by `update_runs` | Pairs each submitted run with its selected byte range. |
| `TextSelectionSnapshot` | Produced when selection changes | Describes the participant's endpoints and coverage. |
| `TextSelectionEvent` | Emitted to subscribers | Reports selection changes, clearing, and auto-scroll requests. |
| `TextSelectionContentKey` | Stable content identity | Identifies virtualized content at a selection endpoint. |

The complete flow is:

1. Retain one `TextSelectionLayer` element at the window root.
2. Create one `TextSelectionHandle` for each independently selectable participant.
3. During prepaint, call `TextSelectionHandle::register` with a `TextSelectionRegistration`.
4. During paint, pass laid-out `TextSelectionRun`s to `TextSelectionHandle::update_runs`.
5. Paint each returned byte range behind its glyphs.
6. Read or clear the window selection through `TextSelection`.

The installed layer also provides familiar multi-click behavior: double-click selects a word using the same boundary rules as `Input`, while triple-click and later clicks select the newline-delimited logical line.

The window state belongs to the retained `TextSelectionLayer` element. Handles and callbacks never receive or own that internal state.

## How it works

`gpui-base` owns gesture coordination and range projection. The application remains responsible for layout and painting across the participant seam:

<img src="/text-selection-architecture.svg" alt="GPUI Base owns gestures, window selection state, snapshots, and range projection. The application owns the selection handle, geometry, text runs, painting, and copying." />

## Install the window element

Add one `TextSelectionLayer` as the first child of the window root:

```rust
use gpui::prelude::*;
use gpui::{Context, Render, Window};
use gpui_base::TextSelectionLayer;

impl Render for AppView {
    fn render(&mut self, window: &mut Window, cx: &mut Context<Self>) -> impl IntoElement {
        div()
            .size_full()
            .child(TextSelectionLayer)
            .child(self.content.clone())
    }
}
```

`TextSelectionLayer` is a zero-sized element. Keep it first and mount only one per window. Calling `TextSelection::activate_scope` before the first prepaint stores the scope until the layer binds its window state.

## Create a stable handle

Create one handle for the semantic lifetime of the participant. Do not create a new handle every frame.

```rust
use gpui::{Context, Subscription, Window};
use gpui_base::TextSelectionHandle;

struct DocumentView {
    selection: TextSelectionHandle,
    _selection_refresh: Subscription,
}

impl DocumentView {
    fn new(window: &Window, cx: &mut Context<Self>) -> Self {
        let selection = TextSelectionHandle::new("", cx);
        let selection_refresh = selection.refresh_window_on_change(window, cx);

        Self {
            selection,
            _selection_refresh: selection_refresh,
        }
    }
}
```

`refresh_window_on_change` redraws only the owning window when this handle's selection changes. Retain the returned subscription for as long as the participant is rendered, or explicitly call `.detach()` when the subscription should live for the rest of the participant entity's lifetime. Use `subscribe` instead when the participant needs events or more targeted invalidation.

The `fallback_copy_text` passed to `TextSelectionHandle::new` is used until the participant projects laid-out runs or supplies custom copy behavior. Use `set_fallback_copy_text` to replace it.

## Register geometry during prepaint

Call `TextSelectionHandle::register(registration, window, cx)` once per rendered frame, after the handle's bounds and hitbox are known:

```rust
use gpui::{Bounds, Hitbox, Pixels, Window};
use gpui_base::TextSelectionRegistration;

fn register_selection(
    handle: &TextSelectionHandle,
    hitbox: Hitbox,
    bounds: Bounds<Pixels>,
    window: &mut Window,
    cx: &mut gpui::App,
) {
    handle.register(
        TextSelectionRegistration::new(hitbox, bounds)
            .with_document_order(0)
            .with_text_bounds(vec![bounds]),
        window,
        cx,
    );
}
```

- `bounds` is the participant's content viewport in window coordinates.
- `text_bounds` contains the visible glyph-bearing areas. Blank-only drags do not start a text selection.
- `document_order` provides stable ordering between participants for cross-participant selection and copy. Do not derive semantic order from a `HashMap` or accidental paint order.
- `with_scroll_offset` maps window points into scrolled content coordinates.
- `with_scope` assigns an explicit opaque scope. A surrounding `.text_selection_scope(scope)` builder overrides it while that subtree renders.

Handles not registered in the current frame stop participating automatically.

## Project selection onto text runs

In paint, call `TextSelectionHandle::update_runs` with laid-out runs containing the exact text used to create each `TextLayout`. It returns a `TextSelectionProjection` containing UTF-8-safe byte ranges:

```rust
use gpui::{Bounds, Pixels, SharedString, TextLayout};
use gpui_base::TextSelectionRun;

fn selected_range(
    handle: &TextSelectionHandle,
    text: SharedString,
    layout: TextLayout,
    bounds: Bounds<Pixels>,
    cx: &mut gpui::App,
) -> Option<std::ops::Range<usize>> {
    handle
        .update_runs(
            &[TextSelectionRun::new(text, layout, bounds)
                .with_document_order(0)],
            cx,
        )
        .ranges()
        .iter()
        .next()
        .and_then(|range| range.clone())
}
```

Paint the returned range behind the glyphs, then paint the text normally. Wrapped selections need three kinds of highlight geometry: the remainder of the first line, full-width middle lines, and the prefix of the last line.

For multiple runs, give each run a stable `document_order`. Input order is preserved in `projection.ranges()` so each range can be paired with its original layout; document order is used when composing copied text.

The [shared Text Selection showcase](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component/blob/main/crates/base/examples/showcase/components/text_selection.rs) is the complete runnable example used by both the native command and the live Rust/WASM preview above:

```bash
cargo run -p gpui-base --example components -- text-selection
```

## Complete Rust example

## Query and control the window selection

Use `TextSelection` associated functions to read or mutate the window selection. No extension trait import is required:

```rust
use gpui_base::TextSelection;

let has_selection = TextSelection::has_selection(window, cx);
let text = TextSelection::selected_text(window, cx);

TextSelection::end(window, cx);   // End a drag, preserving its range.
TextSelection::clear(window, cx); // Clear window and participant-local ranges.
```

`selected_text` invokes participant copy callbacks only after the window and handle state leases have been released, so a callback may safely read or update selection state.

## Advanced participant adapters

Plain text usually needs only `refresh_window_on_change` and `update_runs`. Rich or virtualized participants can configure additional behavior directly on the handle:

| Method | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `refresh_window_on_change` | Redraw only the owning window when this handle's selection changes. |
| `subscribe` | Receive `TextSelectionEvent` values for selection changes, clearing, and auto-scroll. |
| `copy_with` | Export source text or include virtualized content that is not currently painted. |
| `set_fallback_copy_text` | Replace the participant's fallback copy text. |
| `resolve_content_key_with` | Attach a stable `TextSelectionContentKey` to an endpoint. |
| `focus_with` | Focus the participant when a drag begins inside it. |
| `clear_with` | Synchronously clear participant-local state when the window selection clears. |
| `set_local_selection` | Report participant-local selection such as select-all. |

Callbacks are invoked outside selection-state leases. They may update the participant or query `TextSelection` without causing a reentrant entity borrow.

When `subscribe` receives `TextSelectionEvent::AutoScroll(Some(delta))`, feed that delta into the participant's scrolling loop; `None` stops it. Positive deltas move toward the bottom. The shared showcase demonstrates this with content taller than its viewport.

For a virtualized document, inspect `TextSelectionEvent::SelectionChanged` and use `TextSelectionSnapshot::coverage()`, `window_points()`, and each endpoint's `content_point()` and `content_key()`. Coverage distinguishes a bounded participant from one selected from its start, to its end, or in full, allowing `copy_with` to include unpainted content.

## Isolate modal content with scopes

Only handles in the active `TextSelectionScopeId` participate. Set the active window scope, then mark the corresponding rendered subtree:

```rust
use gpui_base::{ElementExt as _, TextSelection, TextSelectionScopeId};

let dialog_scope = TextSelectionScopeId::new();
TextSelection::activate_scope(dialog_scope, window, cx);

let dialog = dialog_content.text_selection_scope(dialog_scope);
```

Scope stacks are isolated per window and are cleaned up even if a scoped subtree panics while rendering. Changing the active scope clears the previous selection atomically.

## Integration checklist

- Retain one `TextSelectionLayer` element as the first child of each custom window root.
- Keep each `TextSelectionHandle` stable across renders.
- Register current geometry every rendered frame.
- Use explicit document order and window-local scopes.
- Pass the exact UTF-8 text used by each `TextLayout`.
- Paint highlights before glyphs.
- Keep parser, source export, and virtual-document knowledge in the participant.
