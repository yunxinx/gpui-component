//! Dialogs, the sheet and toasts, on the script-side `window`.
//!
//! An overlay is a *host* capability, not something a script draws. A dialog is
//! not a floating `div`: it is a place in the window's stacking order, a focus
//! trap, an Escape target, and a promise about what a backdrop press means —
//! all of which [`ShellRoot`] decides for the window as a whole, because only
//! something that sees every overlay at once can order them. A script that drew
//! its own dialog would own none of that, and two scripts drawing two dialogs
//! would own even less. So the script says *what* to put in front of the user,
//! and the root says where it goes and how it leaves.
//!
//! # Why `window` and not `cx`
//!
//! A dialog belongs to the **window**, not to the view that opened it.
//! `cx.notify()` re-renders this view; `window.open_dialog()` changes what the
//! window is showing. Hanging both off one object said they were the same kind
//! of thing. `gpui-component` draws exactly this line — `window.open_dialog`,
//! `window.push_notification` — and the script API spells it the same way, so a
//! reader moving between the two halves of an application is reading one
//! vocabulary rather than two.
//!
//! And `window` is somewhere to grow. Overlays are what it carries today;
//! `Window` in Rust also answers focus, size and appearance, and a script will
//! want some of that. Those land in a namespace that already exists. Flat
//! exports would either sprawl across the module or have to be gathered into a
//! namespace later, which is a rename every application would feel.
//!
//! It also removed a failure mode. On `cx` these calls carried a generation, so
//! a `cx` stashed in a closure and used later reached a dead stack frame and had
//! to be caught. `window` is ambient like `fs` and `store` — it reads the call
//! that is running *now* — so there is no stale handle to hold.
//!
//! # Why every entry point checks the phase first
//!
//! Opening or closing an overlay mutates the window, and the render pass is
//! reading it. GPUI's borrow model has no way to express "the script may notify
//! from here but not from there", so [`crate::scope`] carries the phase and each
//! entry point refuses `Render` and `Layout` (design doc §16.2). The check lives
//! here as well as in [`ShellRoot`] because the two refusals are different
//! things: the root logs and ignores, which is the right answer for host code
//! that got it wrong, while a script gets a thrown `TypeError` naming the phase
//! it called from — the same shape the style layer uses for an unknown method,
//! and the only shape an author can act on.
//!
//! # The script surface
//!
//! `window` is a global. There is nothing to import, and unlike `cx`, nothing
//! hands it to you either.
//!
//! ```js
//!
//! import { v_flex } from "gpui-base";
//!
//! const depth = window.open_dialog(() => v_flex().child("Delete?"), {
//!   escape_dismissable: false,
//!   backdrop_dismissable: false,
//! });
//! window.close_dialog();       // -> did anything close?
//! window.close_all_dialogs();  // -> how many closed
//! window.has_active_dialog();
//!
//! window.open_sheet(() => filters());          // right, the default placement
//! window.open_sheet_at("left", () => nav());
//! window.close_sheet();        // -> did anything close?
//! window.has_active_sheet();
//!
//! window.push_toast({ title: "Saved", description: "3 files", level: "success",
//!                     timeout: 4000, id: "save" });
//! window.remove_toast("save");
//! window.clear_toasts();
//! ```
//!
//! # Why the content is a function
//!
//! `open_dialog` takes a function returning an element, not an element. An
//! element belongs to the arena of the render pass that built it, and a dialog
//! outlives the call that opened it — so an element built at open time would
//! belong to the wrong pass. The function is called when the dialog renders, and
//! again whenever it re-renders, which is the same contract a view's `render`
//! has. Whatever it closes over is the dialog's state.
//!
//! What it closes over is usually another view's state, and this call answers a
//! depth rather than a handle — so there is nothing for a script to notify when
//! that state moves. `window.refresh()` is the call for it: the root redraws,
//! and an overlay built from a script rebuilds with it rather than
//! re-materializing the description it was opened with.
