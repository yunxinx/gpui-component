//! Promises, timers and task ownership on GPUI's foreground executor
//! (design doc §12).
//!
//! Script code is asynchronous in the ordinary JavaScript way: `async` functions
//! and native promises. What this module supplies is the half a bare QuickJS
//! runtime does not have — a clock, an owner for pending work, and somebody to
//! pump the job queue.
//!
//! # Which `cx` may be held across an `await`
//!
//! GPUI hands the host `&mut Window` and `&mut App` as borrows that live exactly
//! as long as one call, and offers `AsyncApp` for the code that has to outlive
//! one. The two script flavours mirror that. A call-scoped `cx` is a generation
//! token for one call ([`crate::scope`]); an `await` returns to the host, the
//! frame goes away, and the token is stale when the continuation runs — a clear
//! [`crate::scope::StaleContext`] error rather than undefined behaviour.
//!
//! ```js
//! cx.spawn(async (cx) => {
//!   const data = await load();
//!   cx.notify();              // the async cx: it names no frame to go stale
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! Every resumption this module drives opens a *fresh* [`ScopePhase::Task`]
//! scope, which is what the async flavour resolves against.
//!
//! # The job queue
//!
//! QuickJS keeps promise reactions in a job queue that only runs when the host
//! asks it to. Nothing — no `.then`, no continuation after an `await` — happens
//! until somebody calls [`drain_jobs`]. **The engine must call it after every
//! script entry point** (click, change, timer, load); see that function's
//! documentation for the exact placement, which is inside the entry point's
//! scope and outside `Context::with`.
//!
//! Building a render snapshot is the one entry point that does *not* drain
//! inline. A continuation is arbitrary application code with no bound on how
//! long it runs, and a render is the last place that belongs; see
//! [`drain_after_render`].
//!
//! # Ownership and cancellation
//!
//! Every task retains the application policy active at creation. Tasks may also
//! belong to a view through `opts.owner` or [`scope::current_view`]; that weak
//! owner prevents callbacks from writing into a view that has gone away. The
//! policy is the stable application identity used by load, reload, and unload,
//! including for module-top-level work created before a view exists. Explicit
//! `cancel()` stops work on demand. A cancelled promise is simply never settled.

/// the queue, `await` never resumes and the failure is silent — no error, no

/// JavaScript ends with a drain:
///
/// - `dispatch_click` / `dispatch_change`, after the handler;
/// - `build_snapshot`, on the next turn of the event loop rather than inline —
///   see [`drain_after_render`];
/// - `load_source` / `instantiate`, after top-level module evaluation;
/// - every resumption this module drives, which is handled here already.
///
/// Two placement rules, both load-bearing:
///
/// 1. **Outside `Context::with`.** [`JsRuntime::execute_pending_job`] takes the
///    runtime lock that `Context::with` is already holding, so calling it from
///    inside a `with_js` closure deadlocks (or, without the `parallel` feature,
///    panics on a re-entrant `RefCell` borrow).
/// 2. **Inside the entry point's [`crate::scope`] guard.** A continuation is
///    resumed script code and will call `gpui.with_cx`, which needs a live
///    scope. Draining after the guard drops leaves that code with no context at
///    all. For an entry point whose own phase is not `Task` — a render pass —
///    open a fresh `ScopePhase::Task` scope around the drain instead.
///
/// A job that throws is reported and the drain continues: one broken
/// continuation must not stop the others.
