//! What a piece of running script is allowed to do, and who answers for it.
//!
//! A policy is the capability grant, the settings file and the HostModules,
//! held together because they answer the same question: *this code, right now,
//! under whose authority?*
//!
//! # Why it is not thread state
//!
//! It used to be. `set_capabilities` wrote into a thread-local and every `fs`
//! call read it back, which is sound for exactly one running application and
//! wrong the moment there are two. Two runtimes on one thread shared the last
//! installer's permissions; and a plugin host — two plugins inside *one*
//! runtime — could only install one grant at a time and swap it around each
//! call.
//!
//! That swap cannot be made correct, and the reason is worth stating because it
//! rules out the obvious repairs. It is a guard in *time*:
//!
//! ```text
//! activate(A) ─▶ A runs ─▶ await ────────────────▶ A resumes
//!                                  activate(B)         ↑
//!                                                 under B's grant
//! ```
//!
//! `await` crosses time. So does a second panel rendering between two frames of
//! the first. Anything that answers "whose grant?" by asking what was installed
//! most recently is answering a question about the past.
//!
//! Moving the state onto the runtime does not help either: two plugins share one
//! runtime, so they would share the field.
//!
//! # Where it lives instead
//!
//! On the call. The internal call scope already pushes a frame for every entry into
//! script and pops it on the way out — it exists to answer "am I inside a legal
//! host call?" — so the policy is a field of that frame. Code executing under a
//! frame reads its policy; a continuation resuming after an `await` brings its
//! own frame back with it, and nothing can be swapped underneath it.
//!
//! A [`crate::view::ScriptView`] carries the policy its script runs under, and
//! every entry point that has a view takes the policy from it. The entry points
//! that have no view yet — loading a module, constructing a view — take one
//! explicitly, because "under whose authority is this code being loaded" is a
//! question the caller has to answer rather than inherit.
