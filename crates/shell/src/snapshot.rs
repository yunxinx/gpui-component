//! What a script render produces, and what many GPUI frames consume.
//!
//! A GPUI render is not a script render. GPUI repaints for reasons the script
//! knows nothing about — a cursor blink, a hover, a scroll, an animation frame —
//! and none of those are a reason to enter the VM. So a script `render()` no
//! longer describes *this frame*; it describes the current interface, once, into
//! a [`RenderSnapshot`] that stays valid until script state says otherwise.
//!
//! ```text
//! script state changes ──▶ build snapshot ──▶ ┌───────────┐
//!                                             │ snapshot  │
//!                                             └───────────┘
//!                                                  │  │  │
//!                          many GPUI frames ◀──────┘  │  │
//!                                       materialize ◀─┘  │
//!                                              (no VM) ◀─┘
//! ```
//!
//! The snapshot owns everything materialization needs: the element descriptions,
//! the root, and — indirectly, through its generation — the handlers the script
//! registered while building it. That ownership is the point. When the snapshot
//! is dropped its callbacks are retired with it, which is what lets several
//! views share one runtime without one view's render invalidating another's
//! buttons.
//!
//! # Where the diagram is not the whole truth
//!
//! One component breaks the right-hand column: a virtualized list. Its rows
//! depend on where it has been scrolled, which GPUI only knows during layout,
//! so its item renderer is called from there — twice a frame, per list — and
//! those calls do enter the VM:
//!
//! ```text
//!                                             ┌───────────┐
//!                                             │ snapshot  │
//!                                             └───────────┘
//!                                                  │
//!                          many GPUI frames ◀──────┤
//!                                       materialize │
//!                                                  └──▶ VirtualList rows ──▶ VM
//! ```
//!
//! What it does not break is the claim the arrangement was built for. The VM is
//! entered for the *visible window* rather than for the collection, so a
//! ten-thousand-row list costs what a twenty-row one costs — and the
//! alternative, describing every row into the snapshot up front, is precisely
//! the cost virtualization exists to remove. Nothing else in an interface
//! repaints through script. [`crate::materialize`] states the exception in
//! full, along with the three things that confine it.
