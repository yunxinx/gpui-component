//! Turns element descriptions into real GPUI elements.
//!
//! This runs entirely in Rust: it never calls back into the script, which is what
//! makes it possible to benchmark and snapshot-test the render path
//! independently of the VM — and, more importantly, what lets GPUI repaint a
//! script view as often as it likes without entering one.
//!
//! Reading a snapshot leaves it intact, so the same description is replayed by
//! every frame until script state replaces it. The runtime is still needed here,
//! but only to dispatch events: no path through this module calls into the
//! script while an element is being built.
//!
//! # The one exception: `VirtualList`
//!
//! A virtualized list is the single component whose description is not the
//! whole of what it draws. Its rows are produced by a script callback that
//! GPUI runs from *inside* layout and prepaint — twice per frame, once to
//! measure and once to place — so a frame that contains a virtual list does
//! enter the VM, once per list, no matter what changed.
//!
//! That is not a leak in the design; it is the trade the design was for. The
//! alternative is describing every row up front, which is exactly the cost
//! virtualization exists to avoid: ten thousand rows described so that twenty
//! can be seen. What the exception buys is that the VM is entered for the
//! *visible window* rather than for the collection, so the script cost of a
//! ten-thousand-row list is the script cost of a twenty-row one.
//!
//! Three things confine it, and they are worth naming because each is what
//! stops the exception from spreading:
//!
//! * **It is scoped.** Item rendering runs under [`ScopePhase::Layout`], which
//!   forbids `cx.notify()` (a re-render requested from inside layout is a loop),
//!   forbids creating retained state, and runs on the render-time budget.
//! * **It registers nothing.** Callbacks cannot be registered from an item
//!   renderer — see [`components::virtual_list`] for why, and for what a script
//!   uses instead.
//! * **It owns no arena.** Each batch describes itself into a temporary
//!   [`SpecArena`] that is materialized through [`materialize_subtree`] and
//!   dropped before the call returns, so nothing a row described outlives the
//!   frame that drew it.
//!
//! The cost lands in `materialize_time` rather than in `script_render_time`;
//! [`crate::metrics`] says what that means for reading the two counters.
//!
