//! `Collapsible` — an element with one gated slot, and nothing else.
//!
//! Base's `Collapsible` is a `div` that renders the element in its `content`
//! slot only while `open` is true. It has no role, announces no expanded state,
//! draws no chevron and animates nothing; ordinary children are rendered either
//! way, which is where a header or a trigger goes. The button that flips the
//! state, the look of it and any transition are the script's own, exactly as
//! they are for a `Checkbox`.
//!
//! It is the first user of [`SpecOp::Slot`](crate::spec::SpecOp::Slot) because
//! one `children` list cannot say "this one is different": the content has to
//! be renderable somewhere else, or not at all.
