//! `Select`, `Combobox` and `DatePicker` — three headless combobox roots.
//!
//! None of the three holds a value, a list of options or a date, and none of
//! them draws anything. What they own is the combobox role, the controlled
//! `open` state, and the transfer of the keyboard between the trigger and the
//! popup content. Everything on screen — the trigger, the list, the highlight,
//! the calendar — is the script's own, put inside the root as ordinary
//! children, usually wrapped in a [`Popup`](super::popover::popup) so that it
//! floats above the window instead of pushing the layout around.
//!
//! # What the shell does not give them, and what a script can
//!
//! Base opens the surface on ↑ / ↓ / Enter, moves the keyboard to the content
//! handle, and then calls `cx.propagate()` — it expects whatever is inside the
//! surface to take over and run the highlight from there. In a Rust
//! application that "whatever" is a list with key bindings of its own.
//!
//! Nothing here supplies one, so out of the box the control is complete with a
//! pointer, opens and closes from the keyboard, and cannot be *navigated* from
//! the keyboard once open. That is written into `gpui.d.ts` rather than left
//! for a script author to discover.
//!
//! What changed since this was written is that the script can now supply the
//! missing half itself: `on_key_down` on the content element, or ↑ / ↓ bound
//! to actions under its own `key_context` (§10.5, §10.6). Nothing in this file
//! had to change for that, which is what `content_focus_handle` was bound for
//! — the focus does move, so a script drawing its highlight from
//! `handle.is_focused()` already got the right answer.
//!
//! `DatePicker` loses more than the other two. It handles Confirm and Cancel
//! but sets no key context of its own, and every binding base installs is
//! scoped to one — `crates/ui` supplies both halves for its own picker, and the
//! shell can supply neither. So its `on_open_change` never fires from the
//! keyboard at all, and a script opens the picker from a press on the trigger
//! it drew. What is left still earns the binding: the combobox role, the
//! announced expanded state, and a trigger that is really in the Tab order.
//!
//! # Why the active option is the script's job
//!
//! GPUI marks the active descendant on the *option element* rather than on the
//! container, so a root that never sees the options cannot mark one — base's
//! own doc comment says as much. A script highlights an option by calling
//! `aria_active_descendant()` on it. That is the whole protocol, and no wiring
//! here can stand in for it.
