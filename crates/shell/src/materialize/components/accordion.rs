//! `Accordion` — five parts, each of which is a chain of concrete types.
//!
//! Base's accordion is composed the way HTML composes a disclosure list: a
//! group holds items, an item connects a heading with a region, and the
//! heading owns the button that asks for the opposite of the item's `open`.
//! None of the five draws anything — no chevron, no border, no animation, no
//! layout. What they carry is the semantics a screen reader reads: the group,
//! the heading and its level, the button and its expanded state, and the
//! region the button controls.
//!
//! # Why the whole subtree is resolved rather than materialized
//!
//! `AccordionItem::header` takes an `AccordionHeader`, `AccordionHeader::new`
//! takes an `AccordionTrigger`, and `AccordionItem::panel` takes an
//! `AccordionPanel`. None of them takes an element. So an already-materialized
//! `AnyElement` is useless at every level, and the item has to read its own
//! subtree back out of the description and rebuild it — three types deep.
//!
//! That is also what makes the controlled state work. `AccordionItem::render`
//! passes its `open` down to both the header and the panel, so a script sets
//! it once on the item rather than three times in agreement with itself: the
//! trigger announces it, the panel mounts on it, and neither can drift from
//! the other.
