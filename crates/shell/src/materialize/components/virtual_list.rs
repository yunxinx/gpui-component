//! `v_virtual_list` / `h_virtual_list` — the one component that enters the VM
//! on a frame's budget.
//!
//! Every other binding in this directory turns a finished description into
//! elements and never calls script again. A virtualized list cannot: which rows
//! exist depends on where the list has been scrolled, and GPUI only knows that
//! during layout. So base's `render_items` closure runs from inside layout and
//! prepaint — once to measure a representative item, once to place the visible
//! window — and each of those calls reaches the script.
//!
//! The exception is stated in full in [`crate::materialize`]'s module comment,
//! along with what confines it. This file is about the two decisions the
//! confinement forced.
//!
//! # A row cannot register a handler
//!
//! The natural script for a list is `row.on_click(...)`, one handler per row.
//! It cannot work here, and the reason is worth writing down because it is not
//! obvious from either side.
//!
//! Callbacks belong to the snapshot that registered them: a generation is
//! opened when a script render begins, committed when it succeeds, and retired
//! when the snapshot drops. That lifetime is exactly right for a description
//! that stands until script state changes — and exactly wrong for a row, which
//! is rebuilt on every frame the list is on screen. Twenty visible rows over a
//! thousand frames of scrolling would leave twenty thousand persistent
//! JavaScript functions in the arena, unreachable and unreleased, for as long
//! as the view stood.
//!
//! So registering one is refused where it is written, and the list carries a
//! single `on_item_click((key, cx) => …)` instead — registered from the view's
//! `render()`, in the ordinary way, with the ordinary lifetime. The key comes
//! from the list's required `get_key(index)` and is captured with the hit box.
//! An event delivered from an older frame therefore still identifies the item
//! that owned that box rather than whichever item later moved into its index.
//!
//! What it does not cover is a row with *several* independently clickable
//! parts. Doing that properly needs a callback generation scoped to a batch of
//! items — opened when the batch is described, retired when the next batch
//! replaces it — which is a lifetime `CallbackArena` does not have today. The
//! shape is recorded in the implementation plan as P9; nothing here forecloses
//! it, and the refusal above becomes an ordinary registration against the
//! batch's generation when it exists.
//!
//! # The geometry is base's, the pairing is by name
//!
//! Base's `VirtualList` paints no scrollbar of its own — its showcase puts one
//! beside it — so the bar is an explicit [`Scrollbar`] the script places, paired
//! with the list by the id both were given. See
//! [`crate::materialize::components::scrollbar`] for how that pairing works;
//! all this file does is make sure the position the list scrolls is the one
//! filed under its name.
//!
