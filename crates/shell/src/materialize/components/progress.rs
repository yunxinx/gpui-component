//! `Progress`, `ProgressTrack` and `ProgressIndicator` — a progress bar
//! assembled from three parts, none of which draws anything.
//!
//! `Progress` is the announcement, not the bar: it carries the progress role
//! and the `0..=100` numeric value a screen reader reads out, and otherwise
//! paints exactly what any other empty element paints — nothing. The track and
//! the indicator carry no semantics at all; each is a plain element with the
//! script's own styles on it. So the visible bar is whatever the script builds:
//! a track sized and filled by the script, holding an indicator whose width the
//! script sets from the same number it passed to `value`.
//!
//! `value` is clamped to `0..=100` by base, and `indeterminate(true)` withdraws
//! the value from the accessibility tree rather than changing it — "still
//! working, no idea how far" is a different announcement from "at 40%". It does
//! not animate anything: a barber-pole or a sliding indicator is the script's to
//! draw, and `transition`/`spring` on the indicator is how it moves.
