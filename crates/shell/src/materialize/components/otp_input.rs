//! `OtpInput` — a fixed-length code whose cells are drawn by the shell.
//!
//! Base's `OtpInput` is the keyboard and the focus and nothing else: "unstyled
//! OTP interaction root. Applications provide the visual cells as children." A
//! `gpui-component` application does exactly that, building one box per digit
//! from `value()`, `len()`, `is_masked()` and `cursor_visible()` on every
//! frame.
//!
//! # Why the cells are not the script's
//!
//! A script renders once; what it produced is frozen into a `RenderSnapshot`
//! and replayed by every frame after, without the VM. That is what makes an
//! `Input` work — the glyphs are drawn by the `InputState` entity, so typing
//! repaints without anyone asking the script for a new description.
//!
//! Cells described by the script are the opposite arrangement, and two separate
//! things break:
//!
//! * **Digits appear all at once, or not at all.** For the screen to change as
//!   a digit lands, the script would have to render again, which needs a
//!   callback. `OtpState` now emits `Change` for each keyboard edit, but a
//!   script render still does not own the native cell repaint or caret blink.
//!   Typing the first five digits of a six-digit code would leave the screen
//!   exactly as it was, and the sixth would fill every cell at once.
//! * **The caret never blinks.** `BlinkCursor` notifies `OtpState` twice a
//!   second, but `OtpState::render` returns `Empty`: the notification repaints
//!   an empty entity and never marks the script view dirty. There is no event
//!   at all for a script to hang the blink on.
//!
//! So the cells are built here, from the state, on every frame — and what they
//! look like comes from style templates the script declares once:
//!
//! ```js
//! OtpInput.new(this.code)
//!   .flex().gap(8)
//!   .cell_style((cell) => cell.size(40).border_1().border_color(`#d1d5db`).rounded("md")
//!                             .flex().items_center().justify_center())
//!   .cell_active_style((cell) => cell.border_color(`#2563eb`))
//!   .caret_style((caret) => caret.w(2).h(18).bg(`#111111`))
//! ```
//!
//! This is the arrangement `Slider` already uses for its fill: the script says
//! how a box *looks* and the shell says *when and where* there is one. It costs
//! the script the ability to put arbitrary elements in a cell — a badge on the
//! third digit, say — which is the same price [`Component::SliderIndicator`]'s
//! `range_style` pays, and for the same reason.
//!
//! # Why three templates rather than one with a state argument
//!
//! The shell already has one method per named template — `hover`, `active`,
//! `focus`, `range_style` — all built on the same detached-node op, and all
//! *layered* onto the style underneath rather than replacing it. A
//! `cell_style(state, declare)` taking the state as an argument would be a
//! second grammar for the thing the first grammar already spells, and its
//! declarations would have to be complete rather than layered: every state
//! repeating the width, the height and the border. So `cell_active_style` is
//! declared and applied exactly as `hover` is, on top of `cell_style`.
//!
//! # What masking means here
//!
//! Base stores the flag and draws nothing, so the glyph is the shell's to
//! choose. It is [`MASK_CHAR`], the same bullet base's own masked text editors
//! use — not `gpui-component`'s asterisk icon, because the shell has no icon
//! set it can count on.
