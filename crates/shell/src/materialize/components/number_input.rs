//! `NumberInput` — the spinbutton frame around retained single-line text state.
//!
//! There is no `NumberInputState`. A number input is an ordinary
//! [`InputState`](gpui_base::input::InputState) with a step, a range and a
//! numeric mask, so the script keeps holding the same handle it would hold for
//! a text field and the entity store needs nothing new. The step, the bounds
//! and the mask are set on that handle rather than on the element — see the
//! `set_step`, `set_min` and `set_max` calls on `InputStateHandle`.
//!
//! # Why the two button slots are not ordinary slots
//!
//! Every other slot in the shell hands its component a finished `AnyElement`.
//! These two cannot. Base builds the step buttons itself and then chains
//! `focusable(false)`, `disabled(...)` and `on_click(...)` onto whatever the
//! decorator returned, so `decrement_button` takes a `FnOnce(Button) -> Button`
//! — it needs the `Button` back, not an element of some other type. A
//! materialized `AnyElement` is not a `Button` and never can be.
//!
//! So these two slots are resolved rather than materialized: the described
//! node's ops are turned into a [`Decoration`] — a refinement, its state
//! styles, its accessibility label and its already-materialized children — and
//! replayed onto the `Button` base hands the decorator.
//!
//! That is not a nicety. Base's `Button` is unstyled: zero content and zero
//! size. A number input whose buttons were left undecorated has two step
//! controls that cannot be seen and cannot be hit, and one whose `input` slot
//! is empty has nowhere to type. All three slots are load-bearing, which is why
//! the `input` one falls back to the bare editor for the state the control
//! already holds rather than to nothing.
//!
//! # The keyboard is free here
//!
//! Base's `NumberInput` sets `key_context("NumberInput")` on its own frame and
//! binds Up and Down to its two actions in `gpui_base::init`, which the shell
//! calls. So arrow-key stepping works in a script without the shell wiring
//! anything — unlike `DatePicker`, which sets no key context and therefore
//! loses its keyboard once it is driven from a script.
