//! `tooltip(text)` — the hover label, and the reason the trigger is written
//! here rather than taken from base.
//!
//! Base ships the two ends of a tooltip and nothing that joins them.
//! [`gpui_base::Tooltip`] is the popup box — `div().role(Role::Tooltip)`, with
//! no color, no box and no position of its own — and
//! [`gpui_base::TooltipOverlay`] is the per-window layer that shows one, with
//! the show delay, the grace period between two triggers, the deferred paint
//! above every other layer and the window-edge clamping already inside it.
//! What base has no part of is the *trigger*: `gpui-component` writes that
//! itself, in `crates/ui/src/tooltip.rs`, against its own `Root`.
//! [`crate::root::ShellRoot`] is a different root, so the shell writes it once
//! more, here.
//!
//! The trigger is three listeners and no state. Prepaint records the box the
//! popup is anchored to — the overlay is a sibling of the whole content tree
//! and has no other way to learn where the trigger is. Hover asks the overlay
//! to show or to hide. A press dismisses: a label explaining a button should
//! not still be up while the button is being used.
//!
//! # Why the content is a Rust view rather than a script one
//!
//! `TooltipRequest`'s builder is `Rc<dyn Fn(&mut Window, &mut App) -> AnyView>`
//! and the overlay calls it on *every frame the tooltip is up*. A script
//! closure in that slot would be the first content in the shell to outlive the
//! render that described it and then be re-entered once a frame — the VM back
//! on the frame path, which is the one thing the snapshot exists to prevent.
//!
//! So the bound form takes a string, and what it puts on screen is
//! [`TooltipLabel`]: one small view, built when the pointer arrives and cloned
//! by every frame after it. That covers what tooltips are actually for — the
//! name of an icon-only button — for no script cost at all.
//!
//! A `tooltip(() => Element)` form is possible over the same overlay and is
//! deliberately left for later; `.scratch/bindings/tooltip.md` records what it
//! needs and the one trap in it.
//!
//! # Placement
//!
//! `TooltipRequest` offers `placement` and nothing else: `TooltipPositioner`
//! nails the window margin to 4px and never reaches the shared positioner's
//! `align` or `offset`. Nothing here invents the two base does not have, and
//! the first bound form does not expose the one it does — a script that needs
//! to choose a side is the case for adding it, not a reason to guess now.
