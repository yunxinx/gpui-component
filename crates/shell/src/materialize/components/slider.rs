//! `Slider`, `SliderTrack`, `SliderIndicator` and `SliderThumb` — the four
//! parts of a slider, composed and styled by the script, positioned by Rust.
//!
//! Base's `Slider` draws nothing at all: "applications provide the track, range
//! and thumb presentation as children". Each part carries a different piece of
//! the behavior and none of them is optional. The root owns the role, the
//! announced value and the release; the track owns the press and the drag; the
//! **indicator owns the geometry** — its `on_prepaint` is the only thing that
//! ever writes `SliderState::set_bounds`, and every pointer position is mapped
//! through those bounds; the thumb owns its own drag.
//!
//! # Why the geometry is not the script's
//!
//! The value lives in the `SliderState`, and dragging writes it there straight
//! from a GPUI drag listener — no callback, no script, no new description. That
//! is what keeps a drag off the VM, and it is also what would make a
//! script-computed thumb position wrong: the position would be frozen into the
//! snapshot the last script render produced, so the user would drag, the state
//! would change, GPUI would repaint — and the thumb would not move. The
//! announced value *would* move, because base reads that off the state while
//! the root is being built, so the failure reads as "the screen reader says 60
//! and the knob is still at 20".
//!
//! So the two percentage-derived boxes are written here, read from
//! `SliderState::percentage()` on every frame:
//!
//! * the thumb's inset along the axis, and
//! * the box of the filled part — which base's own doc comment calls the range,
//!   and which the script describes through `range_style` rather than as an
//!   element of its own, for the reason below.
//!
//! Everything else — which parts are nested where, their size, color, radius
//! and the rest — is the script's, exactly as it is for a `Progress`. This is
//! the "geometry belongs to Rust, composition and styling belong to the script"
//! arrangement recorded in the implementation plan.
//!
//! # Why the filled part is a style rather than a child
//!
//! Base has no component for it: in `gpui-component`'s own slider the fill is a
//! plain `div` inside the indicator, positioned from the same percentage. A
//! plain child cannot be given that position from here — by the time a child
//! reaches this module it is an `AnyElement`, whose style is sealed — and a
//! child the script positions itself is the frozen thumb again. So the script
//! declares how the fill *looks* and the shell owns where it *is*, which is the
//! same split `Calendar`'s `item_style` makes for the same reason.
//!
//! # Why a missing `SliderIndicator` is reported
//!
//! `update_value_by_position` divides by the recorded bounds. With no indicator
//! in the tree those bounds stay `Bounds::default()`, the division is by zero,
//! and the value becomes `NaN` — a slider that cannot be moved, reports no
//! error, and looks exactly like one that can. So [`warn_without_indicator`]
//! walks the slider's subtree while the description is still addressable, and
//! says so once.
