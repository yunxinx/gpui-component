//! `dock_area` — the one element whose contents the description does not
//! contain.
//!
//! Every other component here is the whole of what it draws. A dock area is
//! not, and cannot be: the layout is what the *user* changed. A drag, a resize,
//! a closed tab and a collapsed dock all happen without a script render, so a
//! dock rebuilt from a description would put every one of them back the way the
//! last render described it. The layout therefore lives in a retained entity —
//! `gpui_base::dock::DockArea` — and this node mounts it.
//!
//! Three things do cross from the description into that entity, and this file
//! is where all three happen.
//!
//! # The chrome handlers, once per frame
//!
//! Base draws no chrome at all, so every tab bar, dock frame and drag bar comes
//! back through a renderer — and the renderer is installed when the area is
//! *created*, while the handlers belong to whichever snapshot is currently
//! published. [`DockChromeSlots`] is the join: this writes the current
//! handlers as the description is replayed, and the skin reads them when base
//! asks it to draw, which is later in the same frame.
//!
//! Writing them every frame rather than only when they change is deliberate.
//! A callback id is only meaningful while the snapshot that registered it
//! lives, and materialization is the one place that always runs against the
//! live snapshot.
//!
//! # The dock's own content
//!
//! Base hands a dock's content to the chrome as a finished `AnyElement` and
//! keeps whatever the chrome hands back, so a chrome that wants both has to
//! place the content itself. An element cannot cross into script, so the script
//! writes `dock_content()` where the content belongs and this file resolves it:
//! the engine installs the real element in a slot for the length of one chrome
//! callback, and the placeholder takes it.
//!
//! Taking, not cloning — an `AnyElement` is a value that is consumed when used.
//! A description with two `dock_content()`s draws the content once and says so.
//! The slot itself lives in [`crate::dock`], because the engine installs it and
//! this file only reads it back.
//!
//! # The commands a chrome element carries
//!
//! A chrome handler may not register a callback — one created there would pile
//! up for as long as the dock stood — so its elements say what they do with a
//! [`DockCommand`], which names a container and what to ask it. [`with_commands`]
//! is where those become GPUI listeners, resolved against the contexts the last
//! drawn frame recorded.
