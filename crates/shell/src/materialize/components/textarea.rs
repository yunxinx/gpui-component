//! `Textarea` — the frame around retained multi-line text state.
//!
//! Almost everything here is what [`Component::Input`](crate::spec::Component)
//! does, and for the same reasons: the state is the identity, `InputBase`
//! carries the semantics a bare `div` would not, and a click anywhere in the
//! frame focuses the text rather than only a click on the glyphs.
//!
//! Two things differ. The text is laid out from the top, because a paragraph
//! that grows downward from a vertically centred first line jumps as it is
//! typed. And the height is the script's: the layout default is one row even
//! for a textarea — being multi-line is carried by the mode, not by the layout
//! — so `rows(...)` on the state or `.h(...)` on the frame is what makes it
//! look like a textarea.
