//! `h_resizable` / `v_resizable` / `resizable_panel` — panes a user drags apart.
//!
//! Two things make this the first component that cannot use the ordinary
//! children path.
//!
//! `ResizablePanelGroup::child` takes a `ResizablePanel`, not an element. Base
//! does offer `impl From<T: Into<AnyElement>> for ResizablePanel`, so any
//! element *can* be wrapped — but a panel made that way has no `size`, no
//! `size_range` and no `visible`, which is most of what a script came here to
//! say. So the group reads its children as descriptions and builds the typed
//! value itself; see [`ChildSpecs`](crate::materialize::ChildSpecs).
//!
//! And the group is not an element the way the rest are: it implements neither
//! `Styled` nor `InteractiveElement`, and its own render is `size_full()`. A
//! group with nothing around it therefore has no size at all, which is why a
//! Rust caller always writes `div().w(400).h(100).child(h_resizable(…))`. The
//! script's styles land on that frame, built here.
//!
//! Sizes survive a repaint without the script holding them: base keeps them in
//! window element state, keyed by the group's own id (`use_keyed_state` in
//! `panel.rs`). A drag therefore stays put across frames that never enter the
//! VM, and `on_resize` is a notification rather than the thing that makes
//! resizing work — a group that ignores it still resizes.
