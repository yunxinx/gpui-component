//! `Pagination` — the landmark, and none of the buttons.
//!
//! Base's `Pagination` is a `div` announcing itself as a navigation landmark
//! with a label. It draws no page buttons, no arrows and no ellipsis: those are
//! the script's own elements, written with the style surface.
//!
//! The part a script genuinely cannot write for itself is which page numbers
//! to show — the layout that keeps the first page, the last page, a window
//! around the current one, and an ellipsis where the run is broken. That is a
//! calculation rather than an element, so it is exported as the free function
//! `pagination_items(...)` rather than folded into this component — and lives
//! beside that export in the engine, not here, because nothing in this
//! directory is reachable from outside the render path.
//!
//! `PaginationState`'s other members are deliberately not bound. `on_change`,
//! `request_page`, `previous_page` and `next_page` all answer questions a
//! script that already holds `current_page` and `total_pages` can answer with
//! arithmetic; binding them would move a script's own state into a Rust value
//! that has to be rebuilt every frame to stay in step with it.
