//! `Avatar` — the one choice base makes, and none of the picture.
//!
//! Base's `Avatar` renders the element in its `image` slot, or the one in its
//! `fallback` slot when there is no image, and draws nothing itself: no circle,
//! no size, no background. All of that is the script's, written with the style
//! surface onto the three elements here.
//!
//! # Why the image slot is not an ordinary slot
//!
//! Every other slot in the shell hands its component a finished `AnyElement`.
//! `Avatar::image` does not take one — it takes an `AvatarImage`, which is
//! built from an image source. So the slot is resolved rather than
//! materialized: the described node is read back for its path and its styles,
//! and an `AvatarImage` is built from them. The same reasoning as a
//! `NumberInput`'s step buttons, for the same reason: the component needs a
//! concrete type back, and a materialized element is not one.
//!
//! The `fallback` slot has no such constraint — `AvatarFallback` is a box with
//! children — but it is resolved the same way rather than materialized, so
//! that both halves of one component read the same and neither is a special
//! case relative to the other.
