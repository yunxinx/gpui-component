//! GPUI Shell — a scriptable application runtime built on `gpui-base`.
//!
//! > **Experimental:** scripting interfaces, Standard Runtime compatibility,
//! > capability semantics and module behavior may change between minor
//! > releases.
//!
//! The host owns rendering, layout, text editing, virtualization and system
//! capabilities; the script owns composition, presentation and business logic. See
//! `docs/gpui-shell.md` for the design this implements.
//!
//! # Cargo feature impact
//!
//! The JavaScript fluent-style surface is generated from GPUI's inspector
//! reflection table, including in release builds. This crate therefore enables
//! `gpui-base/inspector`, which Cargo unifies across the embedding application's
//! dependency graph.

// # The surface a host may rely on
//
// Everything `pub` here is a promise. That is the point of the list being
// short: a module published because one item across a crate boundary needed it
// is not thereby an interface, and the crate spent a while with `engine`,
// `spec`, `materialize` and `scope` open for exactly that reason — an external
// test needed them. Tests moved inside instead (`src/tests`), because an
// integration test is a consumer like any other and a reason to publish an
// internal representation is still a reason to publish it.
//
// **What a host may name.** The root: `init`, the `set_*` entry points,
// `on_exit_request`, `resolve_app_root`, `failure_surface`, and the types
// re-exported below. The modules: `host_modules` and `policy` to configure what a
// script may reach, `root` and `theme` for the window it lives in, `view` and
// `snapshot` for the view itself, `metrics` to measure. Hot reload is exposed
// through `ShellRuntime::watch`; its watcher implementation remains internal.
// `write_type_declarations_with_components` is the explicit tooling hook for `gpui.d.ts`;
// ordinary application loading updates it automatically.
//
// **Crate-private, and why.** `engine` is the seam and its shape follows
// whatever is behind it. `spec`, `materialize`, `store`, `style` and `a11y` are
// an internal representation. `capability` publishes `Capabilities` and
// `ExecuteGrant` through the root and keeps the resolver — `Access`, `Grant` —
// to itself. `scope` publishes `with_current_app`, which is how a HostModule
// reaches the ambient `App`, and hides the frame stack. `scroll` is the one
// scroll area `materialize` needs, kept here because the shell builds on
// `gpui-base` alone and cannot borrow `gpui-component`'s copy. `runtime`,
// `error` and `assets` publish their types through the root.
//
// **Public because a script drives it.** `dock`. A script contributes panels
// and draws a dock's chrome through the engine, and a Rust host can build a
// `ScriptPanel` or install a `ScriptDockSkin` over the same seam. The plugin
// manifest is public because the shipped binary now applies a local
// application's declared capabilities before loading it.
//
// **Not reachable at all.** `value` and `entities`: a `Bridged` and an entity
// handle are the runtime talking to itself.

/// is the set of names, not the functions behind them.
///

/// Exporting a name twice replaces the earlier module rather than merging into

///
/// [`HostModule::declarations`] is optional but worth writing. With it, the
/// generated `gpui.d.ts` describes the module exactly, and this function checks
/// that description against the functions actually registered — so renaming one
/// half is a sentence at start-up rather than an editor that keeps completing a
/// function you deleted. Without it, the module is still declared, with
/// `(...args: any[]) => any` signatures that check the module name and every
/// export name but nothing further.
///
/// # A host that runs more than one application
///
/// This installs into the policy new views are born holding, which is one
/// thread-local set — right for a host running a single application. A host
/// running several gives each its own [`policy::Policy`] and builds the
/// registry with [`policy::Policy::with_host_module`] instead, so one plugin's
/// modules are not reachable from another's script.
///
/// # Withdraw before going away
///
/// A module's closures typically capture GPUI entity handles — that is how a
/// host function reaches host state at all — so the registry keeps those
/// handles alive for as long as it holds them. A host that goes away without
/// calling [`clear_exported_modules`] leaves them registered, which GPUI
/// reports as a leaked handle at shutdown.

///
/// * The name belongs to the runtime — see [`RESERVED_SPECIFIERS`]. The
