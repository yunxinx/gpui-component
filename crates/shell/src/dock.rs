//! Dock and panel integration: a script contributes a panel to a docked
//! layout, and draws the dock's chrome.
//!
//! `gpui_base::dock` already has the half of a plugin system that is hard to
//! build: a layout that is pure data, a
//! [`PanelRegistry`](gpui_base::dock::PanelRegistry) that rebuilds a panel
//! from a name in a persisted file, and a per-panel `serde_json::Value` that
//! rides along with it. What it lacks is a way for a panel to come from
//! somewhere other than the host binary. This module is that way — see
//! `docs/gpui-shell.md` §15.
//!
//! Three parts, and they are independent of each other:
//!
//! - [`ScriptPanel`] is a [`Panel`] whose body is a [`ScriptView`]. It carries
//!   the script's own `serialize()` payload through
//!   [`PanelInfo::panel`](gpui_base::dock::PanelInfo::panel), and
//!   [`register_panel`] teaches the registry to rebuild it, so a layout
//!   written before a restart comes back with the panel in place.
//! - [`ScriptDockSkin`] is the appearance. Base draws no chrome at all — an
//!   area with no renderer docks, drags, resizes and persists while painting
//!   nothing but the panels — so every tab bar, dock frame and tile drag bar
//!   a script wants has to come back through the three renderer traits. The
//!   skin forwards each one to [`DockChrome`], and a skin with no chrome is
//!   still a working dock.
//! - A **dock command** is what a chrome element *does*. A chrome description
//!   is cached until its callback or resolved native state changes, so it may
//!   not register a handler — cached elements have no script callback lifetime.
//!   A command names a container and what to ask it,
//!   carries no script value at all, and is resolved against the contexts the
//!   last drawn frame recorded, when the pointer arrives.
//!
//! # Engine independence
//!
//! Nothing here knows what a script value is. The script side of the first two
//! is a trait — [`DockChrome`] for the chrome callbacks, [`PanelScript`] for
//! the panel's build and (de)serialize hooks — that the engine implements, and
//! the third is plain data. This module deals only in [`Entity<ScriptView>`],
//! [`AnyElement`], callback ids and `serde_json::Value`, which is what lets the
//! dock work the same under either engine.
