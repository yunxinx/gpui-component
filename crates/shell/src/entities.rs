//! Retained state that scripts hold by handle.
//!
//! The object model has three classes (design doc §7): values are copied,
//! element descriptions live for one script render, and **entities** live across
//! frames and are owned by GPUI. A script never holds an entity directly — it
//! holds a handle into a store, so a released entity produces a clear error
//! instead of a dangling reference.
//!
//! # One store per runtime
//!
//! The store is a field of the runtime, not a process- or thread-global. Two
//! runtimes in one process — a host with two plugins, a test that builds two —
//! must not be able to reach each other's state, and the way to guarantee that
//! is for there to be no shared store to reach through.
//!
//! A handle carries the store it came from in its high bits, so the invariant is
//! also *checked* rather than merely arranged: a handle from another runtime
//! resolves to nothing and reports itself, instead of quietly resolving to
//! whatever that index happens to hold here.
