Usage: gpui-shell <directory> [options]
       gpui-shell check <directory> [--print-spec]
       gpui-shell types <directory>

Arguments:
  <directory>  The application root, or the {ENTRY} inside it.

Commands:
  types        Write gpui.d.ts next to the application, so an editor — or a
               model writing the code — sees the whole API and catches a
               mistyped style method before it runs.
  check        Load and render the application once without showing a window,
               then exit 0 if it worked and 1 if it did not. JavaScript has no
               compiler, so this is what takes its place: it reports syntax
               errors, unresolved imports, a missing or malformed default
               export, unknown style methods with a suggestion, wrongly typed
               style arguments, and an element used twice.

Options:
  --watch      Reload the application when its sources change.
  --dev        Development mode: implies --watch, and relaxes the sandbox.
  --print-spec With check, also print the element description that was built.
  --help       Print this message and exit.
  --version    Print the version and exit.",
        version()
    )
}
