//! HostModule registrations — Rust functions the host lends to a script, imported by name.
//!
//! A script cannot load a native extension. `dlopen`-ed Rust has no stable ABI
//! and, once inside the process, holds every permission the process holds — a
//! sandbox that permits it does not mean anything. So the direction is
//! reversed: **the host registers, at compile time, the Rust it is willing to
//! expose**, and a script may reach exactly that and nothing else (design doc
//! §17.6).
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use gpui_shell::{HostModule, HostValue};
//!
//! gpui_shell::export_module(
//!     HostModule::new("workspace")
//!         .function("project_name", |_| Ok(HostValue::from("gpui-component"))),
//! )
//! .expect("`workspace` is not one of the runtime's own module names");
//! ```
//!
//! ```js
//! import { project_name } from "workspace";
//!
//! project_name();
//! ```
//!
//! # Why an import rather than a lookup
//!
//! A registered module is resolved by the engine's module loader, so a host
//! module is imported exactly like `gpui` or `path` is. The obvious alternative
//! is a lookup — `native("workspace")` answering with a bag of functions — and
//! it loses twice, both times on *when* a mistake surfaces.
//!
//! A lookup puts every misspelled export on the run-time path: the call
//! type-checks, loads, renders, and throws on the frame that first reaches it.
//! An import fails while the module graph is linked, before a line of the
//! application runs.
//!
//! A lookup also leaves the type declarations with nothing to say. Only the
//! host knows what it registered, so the best a generated `.d.ts` can offer for
//! A runtime registry lookup can only return a bag of untyped functions. A module specifier is
//! a name declarations can be written against, so the generated ones name the
//! exports in this registry directly.
//!
//! What the import does *not* freeze is the function behind the name. Every
//! export is a forwarding stub that resolves through the registry on each call,
//! so revoking a module still takes effect immediately — a script holding an
//! imported function gets a refusal rather than the withdrawn closure. Only the
//! *set of names* is fixed, at the moment the importing module is linked, which
//! is why a host registers before it loads an application.
//!
//! # Why an asynchronous function is two halves
//!
//! [`HostModule::async_function`] takes a closure that runs on the main thread
//! and returns a `Send` future that does not. The script gets a promise, and
//! slow work — a request, a query, a large file — stops holding the thread that
//! renders.
//!
//! The split is not a concession to `Send`. It is the rule below made physical:
//! the synchronous half may read host state because it runs inside the caller's
//! scope, and the future cannot re-enter the engine because on another thread
//! there is no `Ctx` to re-enter it with.
//!
//! # Why the boundary is plain data
//!
//! A host function receives [`HostArguments`] and returns a [`HostValue`]:
//! null, boolean, number, string, array, object. It never receives a script
//! handle. That is not a convenience — a handle would let the host keep a
//! reference to a script value past the call that produced it, and past the
//! internal call-scope frame that made the surrounding context valid. It is
//! also what lets one registry serve both engines, since neither engine's value
//! type appears in this file.
//!
//! # Why a host function must not re-enter the engine
//!
//! A host call happens *inside* a script call, which is itself inside a host
//! call. Calling back into the VM from there would run script code with an
//! engine frame already on the stack — re-entering QuickJS, and re-entering the
//! render pass that is currently building an element tree. Holding no script
//! handle makes that impossible to express, and the internal dispatcher refuses a nested
//! call outright so a host that finds another route (pumping GPUI until a view
//! re-renders, say) gets a diagnosable error instead of undefined behavior.
//!
//! Reading and writing host state is fine, and is the point: a function may
//! reach for the ambient `App` through [`crate::scope::with_current_app`] and
//! request a re-render with `cx.notify()`, which is delivered after the current
//! call unwinds.
//!
//! # Reaching HostModule registrations is itself a capability
//!
//! The default registry is empty, and every entry point into it fails while it
//! stays that way — the same shape as [`crate::Capabilities::default`], which
//! permits nothing. A host that installs no modules has granted no extension
//! surface, and a script that imports one is told so by name. There is
//! deliberately no per-module grant: the host chose the module list, so the
//! list *is* the grant.
//!
//! # Why the runtime's own modules cannot be taken
//!
//! A HostModule shares one specifier namespace with the built-in modules and
//! the Standard Runtime, and the resolver chain reaches the built-ins first. A
//! host registering `path` would therefore not shadow the real `path` — it
//! would register a module nothing can ever import, and never find out. So the
//! names in [`RESERVED_SPECIFIERS`] are refused at registration, where the
//! author can still see the sentence.
