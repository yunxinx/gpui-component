//! TypeScript declarations for the script API (design doc §14.4).
//!
//! An application written against this runtime is JavaScript, so the only
//! checking it gets before it runs is whatever an editor can infer. A `.d.ts`
//! turns that into a real contract: completion for a surface no one memorizes,
//! and `// @ts-check` catching a mistyped style name, a color token that does
//! not exist, or `.p("auto")` — which the runtime rejects — at the call site.
//! It is also the form in which the API can be handed to a model, which is an
//! explicit audience here.
//!
//! # One module per crate
//!
//! The declarations are three ambient modules, not one: `"gpui"` for GPUI's own
//! elements and what this runtime adds, `"gpui-base"` for gpui-base's layout
//! helpers, components and theme, and `"gpui-fps"` for its performance overlay.
//! A name belongs to exactly one of them.
//!
//! That is a contract about provenance rather than a filing convenience. An
//! import line says which layer a script depends on, so a script that never
//! reaches for a component says so, and the next layer to arrive —
//! `gpui-component`, whose components are the reason the seam exists — needs a
//! list and a `declare module`, not a renaming of everything already here.
//! Nothing is re-exported for convenience: a name reachable from two specifiers
//! stops saying where it came from, which is the property being bought.
//!
//! The dependency runs upward only. `"gpui-base"` names what it borrows from
//! `"gpui"` in an import at the top of its block; `"gpui"` refers down to a
//! component type only where one shared element prototype forces it — three
//! builder methods and `cx.theme()` — and does it with an inline
//! `import("gpui-base").X` rather than a top-level import.
//!
//! # Why these declarations can be trusted
//!
//! They are *generated from the tables the runtime dispatches through*, not
//! transcribed from documentation:
//!
//! * The style methods come from [`style::known_names`] — the same list the
//!   JS prelude loops over when it builds the element prototype. A method GPUI
//!   adds upstream appears here without anyone writing it down, and a name that
//!   type-checks is a name the dispatcher will accept.
//! * Their documentation is GPUI's own, carried on the same reflection entries,
//!   so hovering `.items_center()` shows the sentence upstream wrote rather than
//!   one transcribed here. The seventy-odd methods bound by hand — reflection
//!   reaches no-argument methods only — carry a description written beside the
//!   name in [`style`], which is where a description that stops matching shows
//!   up in the same diff as the change.
//! * A parametric method's argument type is *probed*: [`argument_of`] asks
//!   [`style::apply_param`] which literals it accepts, so the difference
//!   between `Length`, `DefiniteLength`, `AbsoluteLength`, a color and a bare
//!   number is decided by the code that enforces it rather than by a second
//!   hand-written table that could disagree with the first.
//! * The color union comes from gpui-base's semantic token field names, so a mistyped
//!   token is a type error, and the phase union comes from [`ScopePhase`]
//!   itself.
//!
//! # What they deliberately do not cover
//!
//! * **Capabilities.** Every `fs`, storage, `clipboard` and `process` call
//!   type-checks; whether it is *granted* is a manifest question answered at
//!   run time (§19.2). Types cannot express a grant.
//! * **Element lifetime.** An element is consumed when it is used and belongs
//!   to one render pass; so does the `cx` handed to `render`. TypeScript has no
//!   affine types, so reusing an element still type-checks and still throws.
//! * **Which methods suit which component.** Every element shares one
//!   prototype, so `.checked(true)` is declared on all of them and is simply
//!   inert on a `div`. Narrowing that would mean inventing a type hierarchy the
//!   runtime does not have.
//! * **Retained entities** ([`crate::entities`]) and anything else no built-in
//!   module exports today.
//!
//! # What the host adds
//!
//! Every module the host registered is emitted here too, one `declare module`
//! per name, so `import { quotes } from "market"` is checked the same way
//! `import { div } from "gpui"` is. A module that described itself in
//! TypeScript through [`crate::HostModule::declarations`] is emitted verbatim;
//! one that did not gets `(...args: any[]) => any` signatures, which still
//! check the module name and every export name.
//!
//! That is why the declarations live in Rust beside the registration rather
//! than in a `.d.ts` beside the script: two files describing one boundary
//! drift, and this one is checked against the registry before it is written.
//! `install_host_modules` in `crates/story/src/stories/shell_story.rs` is the
//! worked example.

   * event handler, and the only one the host calls during a frame rather than
   * between them: GPUI decides which rows exist while it is laying the list
   * out, so the call happens from inside layout, twice per frame (once to
   * measure a representative row, once to place the visible ones).
   *
   * Two consequences follow from that, and both are enforced rather than
   * documented away:
   *
   * * **No handlers inside the renderer.** `on_click` and the rest throw if
   *   called there. Use `on_item_click` on the list — see its note for why.
   * * **No state inside the renderer.** `InputState.new()`, `cx.focus_handle()`
   *   and the rest throw there as they do in `render()`, and `cx.notify()` is
   *   refused: asking for a re-render from inside layout is a loop.
   *
   * What the layout pass does *not* cost you is the `cx` you already had: the
   * renderer is a closure inside `render(cx)`, so the row helpers written
   * against that `cx` — `label(text, cx)`, `surface(cx)` — keep working
   * unchanged. The `cx` the renderer is handed reaches the same window and app,
   * and is there for a renderer written somewhere `render`'s is not in scope.
   *
   * The list paints no scrollbar of its own. Pair one with it by name, exactly
   * as with a scroll area:
   *
   * ```js
   * v_flex().relative().h(400)
   *   .child(v_virtual_list("rows", this.rows.length, 28,
   *     (index) => this.rows[index].id,
   *     (range) => this.rows.slice(range.start, range.end).map(row => text(row.name))))
   *   .child(Scrollbar.vertical("rows").absolute().inset_0());
   * ```
   *
   * @param id      Identity, and the name a `Scrollbar` pairs with.
   * @param item_count How many items the collection has, visible or not.
   * @param item_sizes One number for a uniform extent, or one per item —
   *   heights for `v_virtual_list`, widths for `h_virtual_list`. Base takes a
   *   single vector whose *length* is also the count; splitting the two is a
   *   deliberate difference, because mirroring it would put one number per row
   *   across the language boundary on every render, and a uniform hundred
   *   thousand rows is the case worth making cheap. An array must be exactly
   *   `item_count` long.
   * @param get_key An item's stable domain key, from its current index. It is
   *   the row's element identity, and it is what `on_item_click` reports — so a
   *   click queued before a filter or a sort reordered the list still names the
