//! The single bridge between a script view and GPUI's render loop.
//!
//! Every script-defined view, panel, or dialog body is carried by a `ScriptView`
//! entity. GPUI calls `render` whenever the view is notified — and it is
//! notified for reasons the script never hears about, from a hover to a cursor
//! blink to an animation frame. So `render` here is deliberately *not* a script
//! call:
//!
//! ```text
//! GPUI render ──▶ snapshot still valid? ──yes──▶ materialize   (no VM)
//!                          │
//!                          no
//!                          ▼
//!                  script render() ──▶ publish snapshot ──▶ materialize
//! ```
//!
//! The script runs only when something invalidated its snapshot: `cx.notify()`
//! from an event or a task, a hot reload, or a palette change. Everything else
//! replays the description the script already produced. That is what keeps
//! script cost proportional to application activity rather than to frame rate.
