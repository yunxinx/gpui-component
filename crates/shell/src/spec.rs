//! The element description buffer.
//!
//! GPUI elements are values that are consumed when used: `RenderOnce::render`
//! takes `self`, and `ParentElement::child` takes its child by value. A script
//! object therefore cannot *be* an element. Instead a script builder records
//! operations into this arena, and [`crate::materialize`] replays them into real
//! elements inside `Render::render`.
//!
//! One arena is the runtime's scratch space, reset at the start of every script
//! render; a successful render freezes it into a
//! [`crate::snapshot::RenderSnapshot`] and leaves a fresh one behind. Reading it
//! is therefore non-destructive: the same description is replayed by every GPUI
//! frame that materializes the snapshot, which is what keeps repainting off the
//! VM.
