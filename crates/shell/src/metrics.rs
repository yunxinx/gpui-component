//! What the runtime is actually spending, in numbers a test can assert on.
//!
//! The central claim of this runtime is that script cost follows application
//! activity rather than frame rate (`snapshot.rs`). A claim that cannot be
//! observed cannot be regression-tested, so it is a counter rather than a
//! comment: `tests/snapshot.rs` renders a clean view repeatedly and asserts that
//! [`RuntimeMetrics::script_renders`] has not moved, and the shell story shows
//! both counters live while a feed drives the view.
//!
//! Two counters, and the gap between them is the whole point:
//!
//! ```text
//! script_renders    ── follows cx.notify(), reloads, theme changes
//! materializations  ── follows GPUI frames
//! ```
//!
//! # What a `VirtualList` does to the two
//!
//! A virtualized list is the one component that enters the VM from inside a
//! frame: GPUI decides which rows exist while it is laying the list out, so the
//! item renderer is called from layout rather than from a script render. That
//! changes how these counters read, and the change is deliberate rather than
//! incidental:
//!
//! * **`script_renders` does not move.** It counts entries into the script's
//!   `render` — snapshot builds — and an item renderer is not one. The claim it
//!   backs, that script cost follows application activity rather than frame
//!   rate, is still exactly what it measures.
//! * **`materialize_time` does move, and now includes VM time.** Describing a
//!   window of rows and turning it into elements are timed together and added
//!   here, because both are spent on the frame's budget, which is the question
//!   this total answers. `materializations` deliberately does not move with
//!   them: a frame with a list in it materializes one snapshot and renders two
//!   or more windows of rows.
//!
//! So on a view containing a virtual list, `mean_materialize` is no longer pure
//! Rust, and `script_render_time` is no longer all of the script's cost. Both
//! remain the right number for the question each asks.
//!
//! Timing uses `instant`, which is `std::time::Instant` everywhere except wasm,
//! where `std::time::Instant::now` panics outright.
