//! Hot reload: watching an application directory and rebuilding its view.
//!
//! The design (`docs/gpui-shell.md` §21.2) is a five step pipeline:
//!
//! ```text
//! file change detected → debounce ~200ms → tear down the view →
//! re-evaluate the application module → rebuild the view →
//! optionally restore serialized state
//! ```
//!
//! Two properties matter more than the mechanism.
//!
//! The first is that a script error must never take the host down (§21.1). A
//! reload runs untrusted script: the module can throw while it is evaluated,
//! and the view constructor can throw while it runs. [`ShellRuntime::watch`]
//! therefore
//! drives reloads that do all fallible work before touching the live entity, so a broken save
//! leaves the previous working view on screen with the error reported to the
//! caller — the same promise the render-time error overlay makes.
//!
//! The second is that this module stays engine independent. It names
//! [`ShellRuntime`] and [`Entity<ScriptView>`] and nothing below them, exactly
//! like every other module above `engine::`. Reloading uses the same engine seam
//! whatever the engine turns out to be.
//!
//! # Why polling, and what a real watcher would buy
//!
//! The internal source watcher compares modification stamps instead of subscribing to
//! filesystem events, because `gpui-shell` deliberately takes no dependency on
//! `notify`. Polling is honest for the job it has: the host drives it from a
//! 250 ms GPUI timer, and the cost is one `stat` per
//! source file in a directory that holds a handful of them.
//!
//! A `notify`-based watcher would improve three things, none of which is fatal
//! here: latency would drop from "up to one poll interval" to milliseconds; the
//! cost would stop scaling with the file count, which matters for an
//! application that vendors a large dependency tree; and it would see the
//! changes a stamp cannot — a rename or an atomic replace that preserves both
//! size and timestamp. An event-backed detector could replace this internal
//! polling mechanism without changing the public [`ShellRuntime::watch`]
//! lifecycle.
