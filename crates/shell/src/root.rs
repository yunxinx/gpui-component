//! The window-level overlay host.
//!
//! `gpui-base` ships the overlay *parts* — [`Dialog`] and [`Sheet`] each build
//! their own viewport-sized host, [`ToastManager`] and [`ToastStackState`] own
//! stacking geometry and lifecycle, [`gpui_base::FocusTrapElement`] owns focus
//! trapping — but nothing in Base decides what happens when two of them are
//! open at once. [`ShellRoot`] is that decision, and it is the only reason this
//! module exists: it is a stacking order plus a dismissal order, with the
//! smallest presentation that makes them visible.
//!
//! It is deliberately not `gpui_component::Root`. The shell binds to
//! `gpui-base` only (see `docs/gpui-shell.md` §4.2), so the equivalent
//! host has to be written here rather than reused.

///
/// # Stacking order
///
/// Painted back to front, each layer above the one before it:
///
/// 1. **Content** — the script's root view.
/// 2. **Sheet** — at most one, anchored to a viewport edge. A sheet is a
///    *place* in the window, so it sits below the dialog stack: a dialog raised
///    from inside a sheet must be readable, and a sheet raised under a dialog
///    must not cover it.
/// 3. **Dialog stack** — in open order, oldest at the bottom. Each dialog is
///    deferred at `10 + index`, so a later dialog always paints over an earlier
///    one regardless of the order the elements were built in.
/// 4. **Toasts** — above the overlay stack, at the root's toast priority.
/// 5. **Tooltip** — one layer, always topmost. Base defers it above every
///    priority the root uses, so it is the one layer whose order is not the
///    root's to choose.
///
/// Only the topmost dialog draws a backdrop. A stack of three dialogs dims the
/// window once, not three times, and the single backdrop is what separates the
/// live dialog from the inert ones behind it.
///
/// # Dismissal order
///
/// Dismissal is always *one* layer, never a cascade:
///
/// - **Escape** closes the topmost dialog only. Lower dialogs render with
///   keyboard handling disabled, so a repeated Escape unwinds the stack one
///   dialog per press and never reaches the sheet while a dialog is open.
///   [`DialogOptions::escape_dismissable`] withdraws the *key binding*, not the
///   underlying cancel action: a close control the script puts inside the
///   dialog still works, which is what makes an undismissable dialog a dialog
///   the user must answer rather than one they cannot leave.
/// - **Backdrop press** closes the topmost dialog, and only if that dialog was
///   opened with [`DialogOptions::backdrop_dismissable`]. A dialog that is
///   asking a question the user must answer keeps its backdrop inert while
///   still dimming what is behind it.
/// - **Enter** does nothing at this layer. Base's dialog host treats Enter as
///   "confirm and close"; that belongs to the dialog's own primary button,
///   which the script owns, so the root vetoes the built-in confirmation
///   instead of guessing which content wants it.
/// - A **sheet** is dismissed by Escape or by its overlay only when no dialog
///   is open, because a dialog above it holds focus.
/// - [`ShellRoot::close_all_dialogs`] is the one operation that unwinds the
///   whole stack, and it leaves the sheet alone.
///
/// # Focus
///
/// Opening an overlay records the currently focused handle and focuses the
/// overlay; closing it restores that handle. Because each open records what was
/// focused at the time, a stack restores focus through its own history: closing
/// the second dialog returns focus to the first, and closing the first returns
/// it to whatever the window was on before either opened.
///
/// Tab and Shift-Tab honour the focus trap that Base's dialog and sheet hosts
/// register, so tabbing inside an overlay cycles within it instead of walking
/// into the content behind it.
///

/// tokens — nothing else. This type positions and layers; the visual language
