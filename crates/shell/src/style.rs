//! The styling engine behind the script's fluent chain.
//!
//! The script writes exactly what Rust writes — `v_flex():size_full():bg("surface"):p(12)`
//! — so this module has to answer one question for any method name a script
//! calls: is it a style method, and if so how is it applied to a
//! [`StyleRefinement`]?
//!
//! There are two answers, and they exist for different reasons:
//!
//! * **No-argument methods** come from GPUI's inspector reflection
//!   (`gpui_base::styled_ext_reflection_methods` and
//!   `gpui::styled_reflection::methods`). `FunctionReflection::invoke` only
//!   takes a receiver, so reflection covers precisely the `fn(self) -> Self`
//!   style methods — hundreds of names (`flex_col`, `items_center`, `gap_2`,
//!   `rounded_md`, `text_sm`, `size_full`, …) obtained with zero maintenance.
//!   When upstream GPUI adds one, the script gets it for free. They are addressed by a
//!   `u16` index so the spec arena can record a style call in two bytes instead
//!   of a string.
//! * **Methods that take arguments** cannot be reflected and are bound by hand
//!   in [`apply_param`]. This is the only hand-maintained list in the module,
//!   and it is deliberately small: about forty names.
//!
//! Both halves feed [`suggest`], because a mistyped style name must be visible
//! at the call site rather than as a silently ignored no-op — see §13.2 of
//! `docs/gpui-shell.md`.
//!
//! # Availability
//!
//! Reflection lives behind `#[cfg(any(feature = "inspector", debug_assertions))]`
//! in both `gpui-base` and `gpui`. `crates/shell` enables `gpui-base/inspector`
//! (which forwards to `gpui/inspector`), so the table is populated in release
//! builds too. [`tests::the_reflection_table_is_populated`] is the assertion
//! that keeps it that way; run it with `--release` in CI.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! `FunctionReflection<StyleRefinement>` is `Copy` and holds only a `&'static
//! str`, a plain `fn` pointer and a `PhantomData`, so it is `Send + Sync` and a
//! `static OnceLock` works — no thread-local fallback is needed. That matters
//! because `nullary_name` is called from `SpecArena::debug_tree`, which runs in
//! tests without a GPUI `App`.

/// Style methods that take arguments, in the order they are documented.
///
/// Hand-maintained because reflection cannot reach them. The array is also the
/// interning source: [`param_style_name`] hands back a `&'static str` from here
/// so the spec arena can store a name without allocating.
///
/// Deliberately **not** bound, and why:
///
/// * `shadow` — takes a `Vec<BoxShadow>`; the `shadow_*` presets are nullary and
///   already reflected, and a real shadow API belongs with the animation and
///   token work in §13.5 rather than as a positional argument list.
/// * `cursor`, `text_align`, `text_overflow` — take GPUI enums. They need an
///   enum-name mapping of their own; every variant already has a nullary form
///   (`cursor_pointer`, `text_center`, …). `font_weight` is bound separately
///   because GPUI deliberately represents it as a numeric value.
/// * `scrollbar_width` — meaningful only together with overflow configuration
///   that the shell does not expose yet.
///
/// `text_bg`, `min_size` and `max_size` are bound even though the design doc
/// does not name them: they are the same one-line shape as their neighbours and
/// leaving them out would be an arbitrary hole in the surface.
/// Style methods that take an argument, with the sentence the declarations show.
///
/// The description is written here rather than reflected because these methods
/// are bound by hand — reflection reaches no-argument methods only — so there is
/// no upstream doc string to read. Keeping it beside the name is what makes a
/// description that stops matching visible in the same diff as the change.

/// the code that enforces it (`argument_of` in `crate::typings`), so the two can
