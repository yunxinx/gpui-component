//! A realtime performance HUD for GPUI applications: frames per second, a
//! rolling frame time chart, and this process' GPU, CPU and memory usage.
//!
//! Frame data comes from GPUI's own frame trace
//! ([`gpui::FrameTimingCollector`]), so the numbers are what the framework
//! actually spent in `Window::draw` rather than an approximation measured from
//! the outside.
//!
//! Render it wherever it should appear, guarded by your own flag:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use gpui::*;
//! # use gpui_fps::fps_monitor;
//! # struct Example { show_fps: bool }
//! # impl Render for Example {
//! fn render(&mut self, window: &mut Window, cx: &mut Context<Self>) -> impl IntoElement {
//!     div()
//!         .relative()
//!         .size_full()
//!         .child("your app")
//!         .when(self.show_fps, |this| this.child(fps_monitor(window, cx)))
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The returned overlay can change its corner, frame budget, and whether it
//! continuously drives the window's animation loop. A custom palette or an
//! embedded rather than overlaid HUD is built by composing [`FpsMonitor`] and
//! [`FpsOverlay`] directly.
//!
//! This crate depends only on `gpui`, so it can be used from any GPUI
//! application.
