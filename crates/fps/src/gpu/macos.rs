//! Sums the `accumulatedGPUTime` this process' accelerator clients report in
//! the IO registry, and turns the time gained between two readings into a share
//! of the wall clock that passed. This is the counter behind Activity Monitor's
//! per-process GPU column, and reading it needs no privileges — unlike
//! `powermetrics`.
//!
//! The accelerator's own `PerformanceStatistics` would be easier to read but is
//! device wide, so it would report the compositor and every other application
//! as this one's load. `task_info`'s `task_gpu_utilisation` is per process but
//! is left at zero on Apple silicon, so it is no use either.
