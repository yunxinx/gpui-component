//! One window, two languages, one ticking quote board.
//!
//! The left panel is ordinary Rust built from `gpui-component`. The right panel
//! is a `gpui-shell` script view whose JavaScript lives in
//! `crates/story/js/quotes/` and is read from disk when the story opens. A
//! separate `crates/story/js/motion/` view demonstrates native motion without
//! becoming part of the quote-board performance comparison.
//! Neither half owns the data: a single `Entity<Market>` does, and the script
//! reaches it through the **`market` host module** this story registers before the
//! script runtime starts.
//!
//! ```text
//!   Rust panel ──┐                                  ┌── main.js
//!   (rows drawn  │                                  │   (rows drawn
//!    with        ▼                                  ▼    with div/text)
//!    Label)   Entity<Market>  ◀── import "market" ───┐
//!                    │            quotes / ticks / watch
//!                    │ cx.notify()
//!                    ▼
//!              cx.observe(...) ──▶ re-renders both halves
//! ```
//!
//! # Why a quote board
//!
//! Because it is the load that decides whether a scripting layer is viable. A
//! feed arrives on its own, several times a second, while the window is already
//! repainting for reasons of its own — and the question the runtime has to
//! answer is which of those two frequencies the script pays for.
//!
//! The board ticks every 50 ms out of the box, and the counters under it show
//! both numbers as live rates. Switch the feed to **Repaint only** and watch
//! them come apart: frames keep climbing, script renders drop to zero, because
//! nothing the script reads has changed and the description it already
//! published is simply drawn again.
//!
//! # Editing the script
//!
//! `js/quotes/` carries a generated `gpui.d.ts` and a hand-written
//! `market.d.ts`, so an editor knows what `import ... from "gpui"` holds and
//! what the `market` module answers. A misspelled style method, a colour token
//! that does not exist, or a host module nobody registered is an error in the
//! editor rather than an exception on the next tick. Regenerate the first after
//! a runtime change:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run -p gpui-shell -- types crates/story/js/quotes
//! ```
//!
//! Nothing but plain data crosses. `quotes()` returns an array of records;
//! `watch(symbol)` takes a string and answers a boolean, or fails with a
//! sentence the script sees as an exception. The script cannot hand Rust a
//! callback and Rust cannot hand the script a handle. Theme tokens need no
//! story-specific bridge: every render receives a live shell context and reads
//! them through `cx.theme()`.
