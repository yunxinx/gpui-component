# Accessibility-driven UI testing

Use the macOS accessibility tree for interactive UI verification. This is the
default manual testing method for component behavior that depends on focus,
keyboard input, selection, menus, or other real window-system state.

## Start the application

Run the Story gallery as a signed macOS application bundle:

```sh
./script/run-story-macos
```

Do not use a bare `cargo run` process for accessibility testing. macOS cannot
reliably address an unbundled executable as an application. The script builds
`/tmp/GPUIComponentStory.app`, assigns the stable bundle identifier
`com.longbridge.gpui-component-story`, signs it locally, and starts its binary.

## Drive the accessibility tree

1. Read the complete accessibility tree for
   `com.longbridge.gpui-component-story`.
2. Locate controls by role, accessible label, placeholder, and current value.
3. Prefer actions on accessibility element indexes over screen coordinates.
4. After every state-changing action, fetch the tree again. Element indexes
   are snapshots and must not be reused without verifying the current tree.
5. Assert behavior from semantic properties such as role, enabled/settable
   state, value, label, focus, selection, and exposed secondary actions.
6. Use screenshots only when the accessibility tree cannot express a visual
   requirement. Coordinate input is a fallback, not the default.

The gallery search field can navigate directly to a story. For example, set
the `Search…` text field to `Input` to expose the Input story controls in the
tree.

## Keyboard interaction tests

Use real key events after focusing the target through the accessibility tree.
For an editable component, cover the interaction boundaries relevant to the
change:

- typing and editing values;
- focus and keyboard navigation;
- selection movement and replacement;
- undo and redo;
- Backspace versus Forward Delete;
- paste, cut, Enter, Escape, and other command boundaries;
- disabled, read-only, and secret-value accessibility behavior.

Read the tree after each checkpoint and assert the control's exposed value.
For undo history, a representative sequence is:

```text
type "ab" -> Left -> type "x" -> value "axb"
Undo                                -> value "ab"
Undo                                -> empty
Redo                                -> value "ab"
```

Also verify that a no-op edit, such as Backspace at offset zero, does not
destroy an existing redo branch.

## Required completion evidence

For UI-affecting changes, report:

- the app and story tested;
- the accessibility roles/labels used to find the controls;
- the input sequence and values observed at each checkpoint;
- any behavior that required screenshot or coordinate fallback;
- automated test, formatting, and lint results separately.

Accessibility-driven testing complements Rust tests. It does not replace unit
or integration coverage for the same state transitions.
